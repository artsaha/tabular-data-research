Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia.

I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available.

Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter.  The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively.  The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time.  Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.,No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time.  The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass.  Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis.  Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature.  Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture.  Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic.  Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site.  Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction.  This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation.  This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision.  This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space.  Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition.

The patient's priapism did return following this and he was scheduled for cavernosaphenous shunt.,PROCEDURE:,  Informed written consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operative suite and administered anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion.  A #15 French Foley catheter was inserted under sterile conditions.  Incision was made in the left base of the penile shaft on the lateral aspect, approximately 3 cm in length.  Tissue was dissected down to the level of the corpora cavernosum and corpora spongiosum.  The fascia was incised in elliptical fashion for approximately 2 cm.  A #14 gauge Angiocath was inserted into the corpora cavernosum to the glans of the penis and the corpora was irrigated copiously until all of the old clotted blood was removed and fresher irrigation was noted.,Attention was then turned to the left groin and the superficial saphenous vein was harvested.  Due to incisions brought up into the initial incision after gauging enough length, this was then spatulated with Potts scissors for approximately 2 cm.  Vein was irrigated.  One branching vessel was noted to be leaking, this was tied off and repeat injection with heparinized saline showed no additional leaks.  Tunnel was then created from the superior most groin region to the incision in the penile shaft.  Saphenous vein was then passed through this tunnel with the aid of a hemostat.

Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used.  A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well.  Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position.  Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well.  At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed.  This was done without difficulty.  Attention was then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed.  After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose.  There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This was evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed.  Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block was then placed.  This aligned us to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made.  It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on.  This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur.  Once this was placed and pinned in position.  Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut.  It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects.  This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This was placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trials were removed.  The patella was then examined.  The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone.  It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed.  At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed.  There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet was then reinflated.  The canals were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial.  Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression.  This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This was then removed and the components were evaluated.  All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion.  The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity.  The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.surgery, knee arthroplasty, revision, zimmer nexgen, distal femoral, intramedullary guide, femoral component, femoral, knee, arthroplasty, intramedullary, patellar, medial, tibial, ', 'label': 25}, {'id': 1870, 'text': 'DIAGNOSES: , Traumatic brain injury, cervical musculoskeletal strain.,DISCHARGE SUMMARY: , The patient was seen for evaluation on 12/11/06 followed by 2 treatment sessions.

This patient has been having what he described as numbness and tingling along the jaw, teeth, and tongue.  This numbness has been present for approximately two months.  It seems to be there ""all the time.""  He was seen by his dentist and after dental evaluation was noted to be ""okay.""  He had been diagnosed with a throat infection about a week ago and is finishing a course of Avelox at this time.  He has been taking cough drops and trying to increase his fluids.  He has recently stopped tobacco.  He has been chewing tobacco for about 30 years.  Again, there is concern regarding the numbness he has been having.  He has had a loss of sensation of taste as well.  Numbness seems to be limited just to the left lateral tongue and the jaw region and extends from the angle of the jaw to the lip.  He does report he has had about a 20-pound of weight gain over the winter, but notes he has had this in the past just simply from decreased activity.  He has had no trauma to the face.  He does note a history of headaches.  These are occasional and he gets these within the neck area when they do flare up.  The headaches are noted to be less than one or two times per month.  The patient does note he has a history of anxiety disorder as well.  He has tried to eliminate his amount of tobacco and he is actually taking Nicorette gum at this time.

The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and opted for an open left inguinal hernial repair with Prolene mesh.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a direct as well as an indirect component to the left inguinal hernia with a large sac.  The patient was also found to have some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for gram stain and turned out to be negative with no organisms.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, the patient was brought to the operative suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  The left inguinal ligament was identified from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS.  Two fingerbreadths above the pubic tubercle, a transverse incision was made.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and then an incision was made with a #15 blade scalpel, approximately 6 cm in length.  Dissection was then carried down with electro Bovie cautery through Scarpa's fascia maintaining hemostasis.  Once the external oblique was identified, external oblique was incised in the length of its fibers with a #15 blade scalpel.  Metzenbaum scissors were then used to extend the incision in both directions opening up the external oblique down to the external ring.  Next, the external oblique was grasped with Ochsner on both sides.  The cord, cord structures as well as hernia sac were freed up circumferentially and a Penrose drain was placed around it.  Next, the hernia sac was identified and the anteromedial portion of the hernia sac was stripped down, grasped with two hemostats.  A Metzenbaum scissor was then used to open the hernia sac and the hernia sac was explored.  There was some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for cultures.  Gram stain was negative for organisms.  Next, the hernia sac was to be ligated at its base and transected.  A peon was used at the base.  Metzenbaum scissor was used to cut the hernia sac and sending it off as a specimen.  An #0 Vicryl stick suture was used with #0 Vicryl loop suture to suture ligate the hernia sac at its base.,Next, attention was made to placing a Prolene mesh to cover the floor.  The mesh was sutured to the pubic tubercle medially along the ilioinguinal ligament inferiorly and along the conjoint tendon superiorly making a slit for the cord and cord structures.  Attention was made to salvaging the ilioinguinal nerve, which was left above the repair of the mesh and below the external oblique once closed and appeared to be intact.  Attention was next made after suturing the mesh with the #2-0 Polydek suture.  The external oblique was then closed over the roof with a running #0 Vicryl suture, taking care not to strangulate the cord and to recreate the external ring.  After injecting the external oblique and cord structures with Marcaine for anesthetic, the Scarpa's fascia was approximated with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures.

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus.  It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision.  It was carried down to the fascia.  An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique.  Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion.  The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas.  It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips.  The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery.  There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie.  The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones.  The fascia had to be opened.  The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully.  When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis.  The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope.  The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl.

One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.

Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.

I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.

Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.  Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall _______ into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries.

She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.  Irrigation of the muscular layer with good hemostasis noted.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl in a running continuous closure.

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.

This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.

He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.

His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee."" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him ""bitch."" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to ""deal with it."",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T\'s life at this time or in recent months.

Mr. T is currently seeing Dr. J for psychotherapy where he has been in treatment since April, 2003.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mr. T denied any history throughout his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders.  He denied any suicide attempts, or profound suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Mr. T furthermore stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,  Mr. T stated he used alcohol following his divorce in 1993, but has not used it for the last two years.

Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T\'s insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient\'s self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.ime-qme-work comp etc., muscle tremor, headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, independent medical evaluation, psychopharmacologic, poor ability to focus, major depressive disorder, tremor, depressive, psychiatric, ', 'label': 37}, {'id': 1617, 'text': 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.

Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.nan', 'label': 38}, {'id': 4786, 'text': 'PROCEDURE:,  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculography, coronary angiography, and successful stenting of tight lesion in the distal circumflex and moderately tight lesion in the mid right coronary artery.

Uterine manipulator was inserted as well as a Foley catheter and this was then draped off from the remainder of the abdominal field.  A 5 mm incision was made umbilically after injecting 0.25% Marcaine; 0.25% Marcaine was injected in all the incisional sites.  Veress needle was inserted, position confirmed using the saline drop method.  After confirming an opening pressure of 4 mmHg of CO2 gas, approximately four liters was insufflated in the abdominal cavity.  Veress needle was removed and a 5 mm port placed and position confirmed using the laparoscope.  A 5 mm port was placed three fingerbreadths suprapubically and on the left and right side.  All these were placed under direct visualization.  Pelvic cavity was examined with findings as noted above.  The left utero-ovarian ligament was grasped and cauterized using the Gyrus.  Part of the superior aspect of the broad ligament was then cauterized as well.  Following this the anterior peritoneum over the bladder flap was incised and the bladder flap bluntly resected off the lower uterine segment.  The remainder of the broad and cardinal ligament was then cauterized and excised.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  The cardinal ligament was resected all the way down to 1 cm above the uterosacral ligament.  After assuring that the bladder was well out of the way of the operative field, bipolar cautery was used to incise the cervix at a level just above the uterosacral ligaments.  The area was irrigated extensively and cautery used to assure hemostasis.  A 15 mm probe was then placed on the right side and the uterine morcellator was used to remove the specimen and submitted to pathology for examination.  Hemostasis was again confirmed under low pressure.  Using Carter-Thomason the fascia was closed in the 15 mm port site with 0 Vicryl suture.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.

The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot was elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  The temporary fixation was removed.  A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done.,After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches.  She is to follow with Dr. X.  She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.

History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.

The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a comfortable supine position.  The operative table was placed in Trendelenburg head-up tilt to decrease orbital congestion and posterior vitreous pressure.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  The lids and periorbita were prepped with full-strength Betadine solution with care taken to concentrate on sterilizing the eyelid margins.  The conjunctival cul-de-sac was also prepped in dilute Betadine solution.  The fornices were also prepped.  The drape was done meticulously to ensure complete eyelash inclusion.,An eyelid speculum was placed to separate the eyelids.  A paracentesis site was made.  Intracameral preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  Amvisc Plus was then used to stabilize the anterior chamber.  A 3-mm diamond blade was then used to carefully construct a clear corneal incision in the temporal location.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome was used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsular flap was removed.  A 27-gauge blunt cannula was used for hydrodissection.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer technique was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove remaining cortex with the I/A handpiece.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  The intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag.  The lens was then dialed into position.  The lens was well-centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure along with stromal hydration.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and well-centered intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Zymar and Pred Forte drops were applied.  A firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.

The patient's parents agreed to performing a surgical procedure to further clean the wound.,PROCEDURE:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap across his lap.  General anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The stockinette was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  There was noted to be some remaining periwound erythema.  There was noted to be some mild crepitation about 2 cm proximal from the entry wound.  The entry wound was noted to be over the third metatarsal head dorsally.  Upon inspection of the wound, there was noted to be hard foreign filling substance deep within the wound.  The entry site from the foreign body was extended proximally approximately about 0.5 cm.  At this time, a large wooden foreign body was visualized and removed with a straight stat.,The area was carefully inspected for any remaining piece of foreign body.  Several small pieces were noted and they were removed.  The area was palpated and there was no more remaining foreign body noted.  At this time, the wound was inspected thoroughly.  There was noted to be an area along the third metatarsal head more distally that did probe to the bone.  There was no purulent drainage expressed.  Area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Pulse lavage was performed with 3 liters of plain sterile saline.  Wound cultures were obtained, aerobic and aerobic.  The wound was then again inspected for any remaining foreign body or purulent drainage.  None was noticed.  The wound was packed with sterile new gauze packing lately and dressings consisted of 4x4s, ABDs, Kling, and Kerlix.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient is to be readministered to the pediatrics where daily dressing changes will be performed by podiatry.

She does have a slowly increasing beta HCG starting at 500 to 849 and the max to 900.  Ultrasound showed a complex right lower quadrant mass with free fluid in the pelvis.  It was decided to perform a laparoscopy for the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus was approximately 10 weeks' in size, mobile, and anteverted.  There were no adnexal masses appreciated although there was some fullness in the right lower quadrant.  The cervical os appeared parous.,Laparoscopic findings revealed a right ectopic pregnancy, which was just distal to the right fallopian tube and attached to the fimbria as well as adherent to the right ovary.  There were some pelvic adhesions in the right abdominal wall as well.  The left fallopian tube and ovary and uterus appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  There was a small amount of blood in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped, placed under general anesthesia, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vaginal vault and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank dilators up to a #10.  A sharp curette was then introduced and curettage was performed obtaining a mild amount of tissue.  The tissue was sent to pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed in the patient's cervix.  Gloves were changed.  The attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was placed without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty in abdominal wall.  The placement was confirmed with a laparoscope.  It was then decided to put a #5 step trocar approximately 2 cm above the pubis symphysis in order to manipulate the pelvic contents.  The above findings were then noted.  Because the tubal pregnancy was adherent to the ovary, an additional port was placed in the right lateral aspect of the patient's abdomen.  A #12 step trocar port was placed under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator, the mass was hydro-dissected off of the right ovary and further shelled away with graspers.  This was removed with the gallbladder grasper through the right lateral port site.  There was a small amount of oozing at the distal portion of the fimbria where the mass has been attached.  Partial salpingectomy was therefore performed.  This was done using the LigaSure.  The LigaSure was clamped across the portion of the tube including distal tube and ligated and transected.  Good hemostasis was obtained in all of the right adnexal structures.  The pelvis was then copiously suction irrigated.  The area again was then visualized and again found to be hemostatic.  The instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen under direct visualization.  The abdomen was then desufflated and the #11 step trocar was removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed from the patient's vagina.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.

Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.

She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum.,The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.,Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States.,In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease.,Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis.,Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed.,Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3.,The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.,MEDICATIONS: , Prednisone was stopped.  Vitamin D and calcium over the counter, we need to verify that.  Colchicine 0.6 mg daily which we are going to stop, ranitidine 150 mg as needed, which she does not take frequently.,FINDINGS:,  On physical examination, she is very pleasant, alert, and oriented x 3 and not in any acute distress.  There is some evidence of faint subcutaneous lesions in both shins bilaterally, but with mild tenderness, but no evidence of classic erythema nodosum.  Stasis dermatitis changes in both lower extremities present.  Mild livedo reticularis is present as well.,There is some periarticular ankle edema as well.  Laboratory data from 04/23/07, show a normal complete metabolic profile with a creatinine of 0.7, a CBC with a white count of 7880, hematocrit of 40.3, and platelets of 228.  Her microcytosis and hypochromia has resolved.  Her serum electrophoresis does not show a monoclonal abnormality.  Her vitamin D levels were 26, which suggests some mild insufficiency and she would probably benefit by vitamin D supplementation.  This points again towards some ileum pathology.  Her ANCA B and C were negative.  Her PF3 and MPO were unremarkable.  Her endomysial antibodies were negative.  Her sed rate at this time were 19.  The highest has been 30, but prior to her appointment here was even higher.  Her ANA continues to be positive with a titer of 1:40, speckled pattern.  Her double-stranded DNA is negative.  Her serum immunofixation confirmed the absence of monoclonal abnormality.  Her urine immunofixation was not performed.  Her IgG, IgA, and IgM levels are normal.  Her IgE levels are normal as well.  A urinalysis was not performed this time.  Her CRP is 0.4.  Her tissue transglutaminase antibodies are negative.  Her ASCA is normal and anti-OmpC was not tested.  Gliadin antibodies IgA is 12, which is in the borderline to be considered equivocal, but these are nonspecific.  I am reminding here that her homocystine levels have been 15.7, slightly higher, and that her methylmalonic acid was 385, which is obviously abnormal.  Her B12 levels were 216, which is rather low possibly indicating a B12 deficiency.  Her iron studies showed a ferritin of 15, a saturation of 9%, and an iron of 30.  Her TIBC was 345 pointing towards an iron deficiency anemia.  I am reminding you that her ACE levels in the past were normal and that she has a microcytosis.  Her radiologic workup including a thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT did not show any suspicious adenopathy, but only small aortocaval and periaortic nodes, the largest being 8 mm in short axis, likely reactive.  Her pelvic ultrasound showed normal uterus adnexa.  Her bladder was normal as well.  Subcentimeter inguinal nodes were found.  There was no large lytic or sclerotic lesion noted.  Her recent endoscopy was unremarkable, but the microscopy showed some eosinophil aggregation, which may be pointing towards allergy or an evolving Crohn disease.  Her capsule endoscopy was limited secondary to rapid transit.  There was only a tiny mucosal red spot in the proximal jejunum without active bleeding, 2 possible erosions were seen in the distal jejunum and proximal ileum.  However, no significant inflammation or bleeding was seen and this could be small bowel crisis.  Neither evidence of bleeding or inflammation were seen as well.  Specifically, the terminal ileum appeared normal.  Recent evaluation by a dermatologist did not verify the presence of erythema nodosum.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004.  She has been treated with prednisone as in the beginning she had also a wrist and ankle discomfort and high inflammatory markers.  Since I took over her care, I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis was there.  Her serologies apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She has a livedo pattern, which has been worrisome.  The issue here was a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 as indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine levels and also iron deficiency.  She also has low vitamin D levels, which point towards terminal ileum pathology as well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hands which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma has been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease, after repeated colonoscopies and the capsule endoscopy, has been ruled out as well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathies and her ACE levels were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 levels in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added as well.  Her primary care physician needs to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile, we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she has a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.  Regarding her heart murmur, we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram.  A PPD should be placed as well.  In her next appointment, we may fax a requisition for vitamin B replacement.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,  1.  Recurrent erythema nodosum with ankle and wrist discomfort, ? arthritis.,2.  Iron deficiencies, according to iron studies.,3.  Borderline B12 with increased methylmalonic acid and homocystine.,4.  On chronic steroids; vitamin D and calcium is needed; she needs a DEXA scan.,5.  Typical ANCA, per records, were not verified here.  ANCA and ASCA were negative and the OmpC was not ordered.,6.  Acne.,7.  Recurrent arthralgia not present.  Rheumatoid factor, CCP negative, ANA 1:40 speckled.,8.  Livedo reticularis, beta 2-glycoprotein was not checked, we are going to check it today.  Needs vaccination for influenza and pneumonia.,9.  Vitamin D deficiency.  She needs replacement with ergocalciferol, but this may point towards ___________ pathology as this was not detected.,10.  Recurrent ankle discomfort which necessitates ankle x-rays.,PLANS:,  We can proceed with part of her workup here in clinic, PPD, echocardiogram, ankle x-rays, and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.  We can start repleting her vitamin D with __________ weeks of ergocalciferol 50,000 weekly.  We can add an RVVT and glycoprotein to her workup in order to rule out any antiphospholipid syndrome.  She should be taking vitamin D and calcium after the completion of vitamin D replacement.  She should be seen by her primary care physician, have the iron and B12 deficiency worked up.  She should stop the colchicine and if the skin lesion recurs then she should be seen by her dermatologist.  Based on the physical examination, we do not suspect that the patient has the presence of any other disease associated with erythema nodosum.  We are going to add an amylase and lipase to evaluate her pancreatic function, RPR, HIV, __________ serologies.  Given the evidence of possible malabsorption it may be significant to proceed with an upper endoscopy to rule out Whipple disease or celiac disease which can sometimes be associated with erythema nodosum.  An anti-intrinsic factor would be added, as I mentioned.  I doubt whether the patient has Behcet disease given the absence of oral or genital ulcers.  She does not give a history of oral contraceptives or medications that could be related to erythema nodosum.  She does not have any evidence of lupus __________ mycosis.  Histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis would be accompanied by other symptoms.  Hodgkin disease has probably been ruled out with a CAT scan.  However, we are going to add an LDH in future workup.  I need to discuss with her primary care physician regarding the need for workup of her vitamin B12 deficiency and also with her gastroenterologist regarding the need for an upper endoscopy.

On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event.  Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan.  With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy.  She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach.  The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it.  There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was placed in supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision.  Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg.  The Veress needle was then removed.  A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen.  A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation.  Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation.  Photodocumentation was obtained.,A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant.  This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix.  Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization.  Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix.  Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix.  Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples.  Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure.  Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it.  The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site.  The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated.  The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic.  Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear.  There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site.  This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty.  There was no evidence of other areas of disease.  Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact.  The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization.  The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2.  Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.

Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.

He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.

Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient\'s sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.

Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.nan"", 'label': 13}, {'id': 360, 'text': ""PROCEDURE: , Skin biopsy, scalp mole.,INDICATION:  ,A 66-year-old female with pulmonary pneumonia, effusion, rule out metastatic melanoma to lung.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient's scalp hair was removed with:,1.

Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band.  A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel.  Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band.

The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.

He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.,MEDICATIONS:, Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today.

It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.general medicine, congestive cardiac failure, ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac, cardiac failure, office, lisinopril, metoprolol, hepatitis, fibrillation, hyperthyroidism, atrial, cardiac, congestive,"", 'label': 36}, {'id': 4491, 'text': 'HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old male who was seen for evaluation at the request of Dr. X regarding recurrent jaw pain.

There was a good brachial pulse palpated.  The artery was cannulated with the provided needle and the kit.  There was good arterial blood return noted immediately.  On the first stick, the Seldinger wire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the right brachial artery without difficulty.  The needle was removed and a catheter was inserted over the Seldinger wire to cannulate the brachial artery.  The femoral catheter was used in this case secondary to the patient's severe edema and anasarca.  We did not feel that the shorter catheter would provide enough length.  The catheter was connected to the system and flushed without difficulty.  A good waveform was noted.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and OpSite dressing was placed over this.,2.  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN TRIPLE LUMEN CATHETER:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% Xylocaine was used to anesthetize an area just inferior and lateral to the angle of the clavicle.  Using the anesthetic needle, we checked down to the soft tissues anesthetizing, as we proceeded to the angle of the clavicle, this was also anesthetized.  Next, a #18 gauge thin walled needle was used following the same track to the angle of clavicle.  We roughed the needle down off the clavicle and directed it towards the sternal notch.  There was good venous return noted immediately.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein.  The needle was then removed.  A small skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel and the provided dilator was used to dilate the skin, soft tissue and vein.  Next, the triple lumen catheter was inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  All the ports aspirated and flushed without difficulty.

A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.

There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.

A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient\'s identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision.""  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.

After this the 12, 6, and 3 o'clock positions were marked with marking suture and the specimen was finally passed off the field.  It was sent to the frozen section's Pathology.  Hemostasis was maintained with bipolar cauterization.  Pathology called back into the room and verified that the regions from 12 to 3 and from 6 to 12 were still involved.  A second margin was obtained from the 6 o'clock position all the way to the 3 o'clock position with sutures again placed in the 12, 6, and 3 o'clock regions.  This was cut utilizing the #15 Bard-Parker and grasped with the DeBakey forceps.  It was passed off the field and sent to Pathology.  Pathology then called back into the room and verified that margins were clear.  After this the bipolar cauterization was then utilized to control a further bleeding.  After this the superior and inferior aspects of the defect were reapproximated with approximately one #4-0 Vicryl suture.  After this the left shoulder that was prepped previously was unveiled.  Surgical gloves were all changed and a 3 x 4 cm elliptical skin graft was taken from the left supraclavicular region.

He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:nan"", 'label': 6}, {'id': 1805, 'text': 'REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of Children\'s Hospital after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder.  I had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptoms and background at that time.  After his discharge, the patient was scheduled to see me for followup services.  This was a 90-minute intake that was completed on 10/10/2007 with the patient\'s mother.  I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEMS:,  Please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information.  The patient\'s mother reported that he continues with his conversion episodes.  She noted that they are occurring approximately 6 times a day.  They consist primarily of tremors, arching his back, and, by her report, doing some gang signs during the episode.  She reported that the conversion reactions had decreased after his hospitalization, and he had none for 3 days, but then, they began picking up again.  From information gathered from mother, it would suggest that she frequently does ""status checks,"" where she asks him how he is doing, and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reactions.  In terms of what she does when he has a conversion reaction, she reported that primarily that she tries to keep him safe.  She puts a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty.  She removes any furniture, she wraps his legs together so they do not knock together, she sits with him and she gives him attention and says ""calm down, breathe"" and after it is over, she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe.  She denied that she gives them any more attention.  I strongly encouraged her to stop doing status checks, as this likely is reinforcing the behavior.  I also noted that while he certainly needs to be kept safe, that she does not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior, and that over time we will teach him ways of coping with this independently.  In regards to his mood, she reported that his mood is quite good.  She denied any sadness or irritability.  She denied anhedonia.  She reports that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning.  He is going to bed at about 11, getting up at 8 or 9.  No changes in weight or eating were noted.  No changes in concentration, suicidal ideation, and any suicidal history was denied.  She denied symptoms of anxiety, although she did note that she thought he worried a little about going to school and some financial stress.  Other symptoms of psychopathology were denied.,DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery.  Mother reported that she did receive prenatal care.  The use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  She denied that he had any feeding or sleeping problems in the perinatal period.  She described him as a fussy and active baby, but he was described as a cuddly baby.  She noted that the pediatricians never expressed any concerns regarding his developmental milestones.  SHE REPORTED THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.  Serious injures or toileting problems were denied as were a history of seizures.,FAMILY BACKGROUND: , The patient currently lives with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40.  They have been together since 1994, and he is the only father figure that the patient has even known.  The father was previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11-year-old daughter who visits the patient\'s home every other weekend.  The patient\'s father\'s whereabouts are unknown.  There is no information on his family.  Mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she was about 3 months pregnant with the patient, and the patient has never met him.  As noted, there is no information on the paternal side of the family.  In terms of the mother\'s side of family, the maternal grandfather died in his 60s due to what mother described as ""hardening of the arteries,"" and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke.  There were 4 maternal aunts, one of them died at age 9 months from pneumonia, one of them died at 19 years old from what was described as a brain tumor, and there are 3 maternal uncles.  In terms of family relationships, it was reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parents, who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother\'s attention, and she noted this is difficult at times.  She reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together.  Mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home, but there is some marital conflict, and this is may be difficult for The patient, as it is carried on in Spanish, and he does not speak Spanish.  There also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter, as there are some concerns that her mother may be involved in drugs.  The mother reported that she attended high school, did not attend any college.  She denied learning problems.  She denied psychological problems or any drug/alcohol history.  In terms of the biological father, she reported he did not graduate from high school.  She did not know of learning problems, psychological problems.  She denied that he had a drug/alcohol history.  There is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncles as well as in the maternal grandfather.  It should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4-bedroom apartment, where privacy is very difficult.,SOCIAL BACKGROUND:,  She reported that the patient is able to make and keep friends, but he enjoys lifting weights, skateboarding, and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing, he really enjoyed that.  I encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity, as this is good for discharge the stress, to encourage the weightlifting, as well as the skateboarding.  Mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in, which was at it sounds like by her description as some sort of boys\' and girls\' type of club.  Abuse of drugs or alcohol were denied.  The patient was not described as being sexually active.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: , The patient is currently in the 10th grade.  At present, he is on independent studies, which began after his hospitalization.  The mother reported that the teacher, who had come to school saw one of his episodes, and stated that, they would not want him to be attending school.  I spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it was probably not best for the patient to be on independent studies, that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment.  He has never had an episode at school, and he needs to be back with his peers, back in a regular environment, where he is under normal expectations.  I spoke with her regarding my concerns, regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day, and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation, where he is not getting his work done, and he gets himself in trouble.  Normally, he would be attending at High School.  The mother stated that she would contact them as well as check into possibly a 504-Plan.  She reported that he really does not to go back to High School.  He says, the ""kids are bad;"" however, she denied that he has any history of fighting.  She noted that he is stressed by the school, there have been some peer problems, possibly some bullying.  I noted these need to be addressed with the school, as she had not done so.  She stated that she would speak with a counselor.  She noted, however, that he has a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school.  She noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization.  His grades traditionally are C\'s.  She denied any Special Education Services.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING: , Denied.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: , Similar to my impression at the hospital, it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder.  It appears that there are multiple stressors in the family, and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction.  I am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment as quickly as possible.  My plan is to meet the patient at the next session to update the information regarding his functioning and to begin to teach him skills for reducing his stress and relaxing.,DSM-IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).,AXIS II:  No diagnosis (V71.09).,AXIS III:  No diagnosis.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, educational problems, and peer problems.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning equals 60.psychiatry / psychology, developmental history, academic background, global assessment of functioning, normal school environment, conversion reactions, conversion disorder, conversion, background, environment, peers, disorder, axis,', 'label': 12}, {'id': 3701, 'text': 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.

The McIvor mouth gag was inserted and gently suspended.  Afrin was instilled in both sides of the nose and allowed to take effect for a period of time.  The hypertrophic tonsils were then removed by the suction and snare.  Deeply cryptic changes as expected were evident.  Bleeding was minimal and controlled with packing followed by electrocautery followed by extensive additional irrigation.  An inspection of the nasopharynx confirmed that the adenoids were in fact hypertrophic rubbery cryptic and obstructive.  They were shaved back, flushed with prevertebral fascia with curette.  Hemostasis established with packing followed by electrocautery.  In light of his history of recurring nosebleeds, both sides of the nose were carefully inspected.  A nasal endoscope was used to identify the plexus of bleeding, which was predominantly on the left mid portion of the septum that was controlled with broad superficial cauterization using a suction cautery device.  The bleeding was admittedly a bit of a annoyance.  An additional control was established by infiltrating slowly with a 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine around the perimeter of the bleeding site and then cauterizing the bleeding site itself.  No additional bleeding was then evident.  The oropharynx was reinspected, clots removed, the patient was extubated, taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.

At this point, we probed both urethral meatus.  Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus.  At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter.  We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful.  We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication.  At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors.  We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans.,At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee.  Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision.  Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans.  Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture.  Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry.

Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and cleansed.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans.  His urethra was calibrated to 10-French bougie-a-boule.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the penile shaft skin, as well as the periurethral meatal area on the ventrum.  Byers flaps were also marked.  Once this was done, the skin was then incised around the coronal cuff with 15-blade knife and further extended with the curved tenotomy scissors to deglove the penis.  On the ventrum, the chordee tissue was removed and dissected up towards the urethral plate to use as secondary tissue flap coverage.  Once this was done, an electrocautery was used for hemostasis were then used.  A vessel loop tourniquet and IV grade saline was used for achieve artificial erection and chordee.  We then incised Buck fascia at the area of chordee in the ventrum and then used the #5-0 Prolene as a Heinecke-Mikulicz advancement suture.  Sutures were placed burying the knot and then artificial erection was again performed showing the penis was straight.  We then left the tourniquet in place, although loosened it slightly and then marked out the transurethral incision plate with demarcation for the glans and the ventral midline of the plate.  We then incised it with the ophthalmic micro lancet blade in the midline and along the __________ to elevate the glanular wings.  Using the curved iris scissors, we then elevated the wings even further.  Again, electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed into the urethral plate and then interrupted suture of #7-0 Vicryl was used to mark the distal most extent of the urethral meatus and then the urethral plate was rolled using a subcutaneous closure using the #7-0 Vicryl suture.  There were two areas of coverage with the tissue flap relocation from the glanular wings.  The tissue flap that was rolled with the Byers flap was used to cover this, as well as the chordee tissue with interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl.  Once this was completed, the glans itself had been rolled using two deep sutures of #5-0 Vicryl.  Interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl were used to create the neomeatus and then horizontal mattress sutures of #7-0 Vicryl used to roll the glans in the midline.  The extra dorsal hood tissue of preputial skin was then excised.  An interrupted sutures of #6-0 chromic were then used to approximate penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum around the midline.  The patient's scrotum was slightly asymmetric; however, this was due to the tissue configuration of the scrotum itself.  At the end of the procedure, stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was used to tack the drain into place and a Dermabond and Surgicel were used for dressing.  Telfa and the surgical eye tape was then used for the final dressing.  IV Toradol was given.

Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.,The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.,The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL: , This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  He denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.,VITAL SIGNS: , Temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.,PSYCHIATRY:,  There is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.

Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.,2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.,My overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.consult - history and phy., noncompliant, confusion, graft versus host reaction, psychiatric consultation, willful behavior, cannabis, "", 'label': 13}, {'id': 4857, 'text': 'REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Atrial fibrillation and shortness of breath.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: , The patient is an 81-year-old gentleman.

Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280).,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia with intubation.,INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic.  He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis.  Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation.  He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity.  However, it is our contention that this patient\'s prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger.  These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts.  Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger.  Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger.  Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary.  Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of ""ping-pong ball sign"" due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers.  However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time.,The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks.  Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve.  This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef.  The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm.  The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease.  Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal.  I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm.  Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel.  The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so.  There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression.  The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified.  The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures.,I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle.  Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass.  In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap.  I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve.,I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm.  The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised.  The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures.  Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips.  I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers.  The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques.  In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner.,I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner.  Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other.  So that in effect a lengthening is performed.  Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures.  I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve.  The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis.  Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound.  A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist.  Fingers and femoral were free to move.  The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage.

The appendix was normal appearing.  The bowel and omentum were normal appearing.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  Peritoneal surfaces and vesicouterine peritoneum as well as appendix and cul-de-sac were all free of any evidence of endometriosis.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the Operating Room where first a spinal anesthesia with Astramorph was obtained without any difficulty.  She then underwent a general anesthesia with endotracheal tube also without any difficulty.  She was then examined under anesthesia with noted findings as above.  The patient was then placed in dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion..  A vertical skin incision was made 1 cm below the umbilicus extending down to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was made with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia with the second knife.  Fascia was excised in the midline and extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum identified and entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with external visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was markedly evident upon entering the peritoneal cavity.  The uterus was then exteriorized and noted to have the findings as above.  At this point, approximately 10 cc of vasopressin 20 units and 30 cc was injected into the uterine fundus and multiple fibroids were removed by using the incision with the Bovie and then using a blunt and the sharp dissection and grasping with Lahey clamps.  Once the debulking of the uterus was felt appropriate to proceed with the hysterectomy, the uterus was then reapproximated with a few #0 Vicryl sutures in a figure-of-eight fashion.  The round ligaments were identified bilaterally and clamped with the hemostats and transacted with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The round ligaments were then bilaterally tied with the #0 tie and noted to be hemostatic.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were then isolated through a vascular window created from taking down the round ligaments.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were #0 tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transacted and suture tied with a Heaney hand stitch fashion, and both uterine and ovarian vessels were noted to be hemostatic.  At this time, the attention was then turned to the vesicouterine peritoneum, which was tented up with Allis clamps and the bladder flap was then created sharply with Russian pickups and the Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was bluntly dissected off the underlying cervix with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,At this point, the uterus was pulled on traction and the uterosacral ligaments were easily visualized.  Using #2-0 PDS suture, the suture was placed through both uterosacral ligaments distally with a backhand stitch fashion throwing the sutures from lateral to medial.  These sutures were then tagged and saved for later.  The uterine vessels were then identified bilaterally and skeletonized, then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps balancing off the cervix, and the uterine vessels were then transacted and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl and noted to be hemostatic.  In a similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the cardinal ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner and transacted and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  At this point, the Lahey clamp was placed on the cervix and the cervix was tented up.  The pubocervical vesical fascia was transacted with long knife.  Then while protecting posteriorly, using the double-pointed scissors, the vagina was entered with double-pointed scissors at the level of the cervix and was grasped with a straight Ochsner clamp.  The uterus and cervix were then amputated using the Jorgenson scissors and the cuff was outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then copiously painted with Betadine soaked sponge.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was placed in the patient's vagina.  Then the cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion to make sure to bring the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the vaginal cuff.  This was accomplished with one #0 Vicryl running stitch and then an Allis clamp was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff and tented up and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff.  At this time, the uterosacral ligaments previously tagged needle was brought through the cardinal ligament and the uterosacral ligament on the ipsilateral side.  The needle was cut off and these were then tagged with the hemostats.  The cuff was then closed by taking the running suture and bringing back through the posterior peritoneum, grabbing part of the uterosacral and midsection portion of the posterior peritoneum of the uterosacral and then tying the cuff down to bunch and cuff together.  The suture in the midportion of the cuff was then used to tie down the round ligaments bilaterally to the cuff.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  Then the previously tagged uterosacral sutures were then tied bringing the vaginal cuff angles down to the uterosacral ligaments.  The abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The sigmoid colon was replaced back into the hollow of the sacrum.  Then the omentum was pulled over the bowel.  After the myomectomy was performed, the GYN Balfour was placed into the patient's abdomen and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  The GYN Balfour was then removed.  Packing sponges were removed and the fascia was then closed in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion with #0 Vicryl.,Skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The sponge from the patient's vagina was removed and the vagina was noted to be hemostatic.

She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke.

ESR 9, coags normal.,EKG is pending my review.,Chest x-ray is read as mild cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic aorta.,Chest x-ray, shoulder films and CT scan of the head: I have reviewed. Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.nan"", 'label': 13}, {'id': 77, 'text': ""PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Bilateral undescended testes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Bilateral orchiopexy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , This 8-year-old boy has been found to have a left inguinally situated undescended testes.  Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal.  The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum.  Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses.  There is a hernia on the left side.  The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision.  An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia.  External ring was exposed with dissection as well.  The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal.  The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring.  Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring.  However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension.,Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided.  This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.,A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel.  The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good.  Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues.,Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion.  However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia.  The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side.  The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well.,The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure.  Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision.  The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition.  Instrument and sponge counts were correct.  There were no apparent complications.

A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum.  At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1.  Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space.  At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar.  The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk.  We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root.

Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.,GENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.  Pallor is improved.,EYES:  Conjunctivae are now pink.,ENT:  Oropharynx is clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.,LUNGS:  Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.,EXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.general medicine, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"", 'label': 36}, {'id': 1702, 'text': 'CC:, Decreasing visual acuity.,HX: ,This 62 y/o RHF presented locally with a 2 month history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OD.

I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.,At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.,When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.,When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had diabetes for five years.  He also has had hypercholesterolemia.  He has had Crohn\'s disease for 25 or 30 years.  He has had a colostomy for four years.  He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn\'s disease.  He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  He has depression.  He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia.,ALLERGIES: , He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife.  He does not really have any hobbies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  He has another sister with diabetes.  He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has dyspnea on exertion.  He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  He has occasional night sweats.  His hearing is poor.  He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn\'s disease.  He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis.  He has a history of anemia.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today\'s visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 160/86 HR 100 RR 16 Wt 211 pounds Pain 3/10,General Appearance:  He is well appearing in no acute distress.  He has somewhat of a flat affect.,Cardiovascular:  He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  There are no carotid bruits.,Chest:  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.,Skin:  There are no rashes or lesions.,Musculoskeletal:  He has no joint deformities or scoliosis.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  Attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  He has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Visual fields are full.  Optic discs are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  He has normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy.  He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.,Sensory:  He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  This is diminished at the right toe.  Joint position sense is intact.  There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  Pinprick is intact.  Romberg is absent.  There is no spinal sensory level.,Coordination:  This is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  He does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms.,Deep Tendon Reflexes:  They are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  There is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or Hoffman\'s signs.  He has crossed adductors bilaterally.,Gait and Stance:  He has a slightly wide-based gait.  He has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  He has difficulty with toe raises on the left.,RADIOLOGIC DATA: , MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z\'s opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.nan', 'label': 13}, {'id': 722, 'text': ""PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.,PROCEDURE:,  Hypospadias repair (TIT and tissue flap relocation) and Nesbit tuck chordee release.,ANESTHESIA: , General inhalation anesthetic with a caudal block.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 300 mL of crystalloids.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 15 mL.,SPECIMENS: , No tissue sent to Pathology.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , An 8-French Zaontz catheter.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 1-1/2-year-old boy with penoscrotal hypospadias; plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotic was given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and the patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans for traction.  His urethra was calibrated, it was quite thin, to a 10-French with the straight sounds.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the urethral plate as well as the penile shaft skin with marking pen and incised the coronal cuff circumferentially and then around the urethral plate with the 15 blade knife and then degloved the penis with a curved tenotomy scissors.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The ventral chordee tissue was removed.  We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee.  In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen.  We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis.  Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight.  The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it.  We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade.  We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect.  We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors.  We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty.  Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans.  We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures.  We then closed the ventral defect.  Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place.  We then used Surgicel, Dermabond, and Telfa dressing with Mastisol and an eye tape to keep the dressing in place.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.

No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed.  Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded.  Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed.  A sterile drape around that was also placed.  The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.  A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.  The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula.  The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used.  Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein.  All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.  The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port.  These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions.  Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port.  Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed.  Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.  The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.  This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.  This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells.  Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.  Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed.  The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler.  Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified.  Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified.  Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.  These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.  The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe.  A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.  Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port.  Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package.  Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken.  The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.  A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.  Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again.  Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.cardiovascular / pulmonary, middle lobe, endogia, fiberoptic, mediastinal lymph node, vats, bronchoscopy, chest tube, chest wall, endotracheal tube, endotracheally, lobectomy, lung cancer, pneumonitis, sampling, thoracostomy, utility port, lumen endotracheal tube, superior pulmonary vein, chest wall lesions, anterior chest wall, middle lobectomy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, anterior chest, lymph node, node, port, chest, bronchus, tumor, pulmonary, incision,"", 'label': 33}, {'id': 2213, 'text': ""PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6,OPERATION: , Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root.,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR.  After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

The abdominal contents were within normal limits.  The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis.  A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty.  The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.  The omentum was freed.  The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  No abnormalities were noted.  At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed.  NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.  Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied.  Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results.  Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally.  The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis.  The last stitch was tied.  Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself.  At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered.  The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution.  The groins were repacked.  Attention was then returned to the abdomen.  The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present.  The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft.  The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position.  There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel.

The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.

General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.

Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.

The need for the tube insertion is because the eardrum incision generally heals very rapidly (within a few days), which is not long enough for the swollen membranes in the middle ear to return to normal.  As soon as the eardrum heals, fluid will reaccumulate.  Tubes were first introduced because of this very problem.  There are many types of tubes, but all tubes serve the same function.  They keep the eardrum open, allow air to enter the middle ear space, and permit fluid in the middle ear to drain.  Most tubes will gradually be rejected by the ear and work their way out of the eardrum.  As they come out, the eardrum seals behind the tube.  Tubes will last four to six months in the eardrum before they come out.  Occasionally, the eardrum does not heal completely when the tube comes out.,The majority of children treated with tubes do not require further surgery.  They may have ear infections in the future, but most will clear up with medical treatment.  Some children are very prone to ear infections and have a tendency to accumulate fluid after each infection.  Children tend to outgrow this cycle by age 7 or 8.  In an ear, nose and throat specialty practice, this group comprises 10 to 15% of all children who have required tubes.  Occasionally the physician has to physically remove the tube from the ear drum.ent - otolaryngology, eardrum, myringotomy, tubes, bilateral myringotomy tubes, myringotomy tubes, ear infections, middle ear, fluid, childrenNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.

She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  A compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.surgery, cervical spondylosis, cervical fusion, decompression, instrumentation, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior cervical, herniated disc, cervical discectomy, anterior, cervical, fusion, allograft, discectomy', 'label': 25}, {'id': 944, 'text': ""PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,OPERATION:,  Cysto stent removal.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local MAC.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose.

CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.

At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.

Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.

Her most recent Pap smear was normal.,FINDINGS: , On a manual exam, the uterus is enlarged approximately 14 to 16 weeks size with multiple fibroids palpated.  On laparotomy, the uterus did have multiple pedunculated fibroids, the largest being approximately 7 cm.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.,There was evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus as well as the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There was some adhesions of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and as well as to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic was first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesions were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis was noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor was then placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was gently packed with moist laparotomy sponges and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus was then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament was identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat was passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl was used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostats were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl was then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion was tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area was entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament was suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This was then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum was then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap was taken down.  It was sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec was left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder was below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine arteries then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner was then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue was transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus was injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix was then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia was then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner was placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis was copiously irrigated.  There was a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder was tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl was placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligaments were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff was synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl was placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament was too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament was incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal areas were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap was reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis was again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue was placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There was no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again was allowed to drain.  All sponges were then removed and the bowel was allowed to return to its anatomical position.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec was removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick was used to assess any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There was no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.  She reports no seizures in the past several years.  She currently is without complaint.,In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures.

The patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  The patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  The patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  The patient has been on IV antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,After an IV was started by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  A restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of Webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the Department of Anesthesia.  After adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  The foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was elevated and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  Using Band-Aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,Using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  Using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  Then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  Care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  After cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  The head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  Attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  All remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  Areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  Due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, I thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  Therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  Deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  This was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  Following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  The wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using Kling and Kerlix and an ACE bandage to provide compression.  The tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  The ACE bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  Sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  The patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.  The patient was instructed to continue her regular medications.  The patient was to continue IV antibiotic course and was given prescription for Vicoprofen to be taken q.4h. p.r.n. for moderate to severe pain #30.  The patient will followup with Podiatry on Monday morning at 8:30 in the Podiatry Clinic for dressing change and evaluation of her foot at that time.,The patient was instructed as to signs and symptoms of infection, was instructed to return to the Emergency Department immediately if these should present.

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.

Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This was done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially.  Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this was then carried out, we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 sutures for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes.,The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.

Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied.,The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia.  A long posterior flap was created.  It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery.  Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb.  Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Anterior compartment was divided.  The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut.  The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments.  The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly.  Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut.,Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula.  The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw.

This was done under interscalene block anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 61-year-old white male who is dominantly right-handed.  He had increasing right shoulder pain and dysfunction for a number of years prior to surgical intervention.  This was gradually done over a period of time.  No specific accident or injury could be seen or pointed.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.

She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.

He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to ""repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.""  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx\'s current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.

She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted.  Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month.  She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal.  I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time.  Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location.  There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive.

She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications.  After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism.  A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view.  This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen.  At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps.  I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no intraoperative complications.

The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area.  There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It was done with radiological guidance.  Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium.  The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area.  The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution.  The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl.  Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers.

The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.

He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient\'s longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient\'s dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient\'s partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was ""useful, but not dosed high enough."" Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.

He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.,Homicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.,Insight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.,Assets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.,Limitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).

After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.

After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.

The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.

The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.

The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.

Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.

Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.

Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.

On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.

It usually occurs from the 20th week of pregnancy to 7 days postpartum.  The cause is unknown.  It is also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy.,ECLAMPSIA, is the end-stage of the pre-eclampsia process.  The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years.  There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia:  family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy).  A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk.  Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage.  Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,MILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.,*  Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.,*  Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.,*  Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.,*  Seizures are possible.,SEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  More blood pressure increase.,*  Further swelling in face, hands and feet.,*  Visual disturbances.,*  Headache.,*  Irritability.,*  Abdominal pain.,*  Tiredness.,*  Decreased urination.,*  Seizures possible.,*  Nausea and vomiting.,ECLAMPSIA:,*  Symptoms worsen.,*  Seizures.,*  Muscle twitches.,*  Coma.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.,*  Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home.

There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted.  It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly.  The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips.  Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.,The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port.

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.

The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.

The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.

Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.

The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.

The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years\' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient\'s wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound\'s bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient\'s history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.

The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl.

She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o\'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.,Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.  Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket.  In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left.  Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured.  No marking was found for the size of the implant.  The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams.  Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.

Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.  Reexamination of the renal fossa at low pressures showed a minimal degree of oozing from the adrenal gland, which was controlled with Surgicel.  Next, the port sites were closed with 0 Vicryl utilizing the passer and doing it over the hand to prevent injury to the bowel and the right lower quadrant incision for the hand port was closed in the usual fashion.  The estimated blood loss was negligible.  There were no complications.

He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly.  The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection.  He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.,FINDINGS: , Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits.  From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot.  This was completely resected.  There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal.  The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location.  Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described.  Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described.  A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology.  The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced.  Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank.  I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria.  Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle.  Complete hemostasis was obtained.  All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator.  Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved.  The irrigant was clear.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant.

That study disclosed the presence of punctate calcifications that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o'clock position.  Additional imaging studies confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications.  The patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o'clock position on 06/17/08.  The final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis.  No calcifications could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue.,Two days post stereotactic core needle biopsy, however, the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast.  She underwent sonographic evaluation and was found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy.  I was called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center.  At the same time, Dr. Y was consulted in Interventional Radiology.  Dr. Z and Dr. Y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this was injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material.  This resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm.  The patient was seen in my office for followup appointment on 06/24/08.  At that time, the patient continued to have signs of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis, which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  There was, however, no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm.  There was no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall.,I discussed the issues with the patient and her husband.  The underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications, which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy; therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings.  For this reason, the patient was advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization.  Since the breast mound was significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy, the decision was to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four months.  The patient now returns to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcifications.,The patient has a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast, which was performed on 01/27/04.  This revealed benign histologic findings.  The family history is positive involving a daughter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40.  Other than her age, the patient has no other risk factors for development of breast cancer.  She is not receiving any hormone replacement therapy.

She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.

This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him ""bitch."" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to ""deal with it."",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T\'s life at this time or in recent months.

Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T\'s insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient\'s self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.

That study disclosed the presence of punctate calcifications that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o'clock position.  Additional imaging studies confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications.  The patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o'clock position on 06/17/08.  The final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis.  No calcifications could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue.,Two days post stereotactic core needle biopsy, however, the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast.  She underwent sonographic evaluation and was found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy.  I was called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center.  At the same time, Dr. Y was consulted in Interventional Radiology.  Dr. Z and Dr. Y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this was injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material.  This resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm.  The patient was seen in my office for followup appointment on 06/24/08.  At that time, the patient continued to have signs of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis, which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  There was, however, no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm.  There was no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall.,I discussed the issues with the patient and her husband.  The underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications, which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy; therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings.  For this reason, the patient was advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization.  Since the breast mound was significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy, the decision was to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four months.  The patient now returns to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcifications.,The patient has a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast, which was performed on 01/27/04.

Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.

The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.

There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.

The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon was noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch.  Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary.  The arthroscopic instruments were removed.  An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision was taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia was identified.  It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon was identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon was identified.  It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified.  The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.

Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there.

Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.

The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area.  There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It was done with radiological guidance.  Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium.  The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area.  The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution.  The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl.  Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers.

The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.

We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits; the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, the need for future revision surgeries.  We will proceed with surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position, and general anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given.  The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X, from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery.  After he was done with his procedure, the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees.  The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut.  A Dingman retractor was placed.  The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, a total of 3 mL, and then, I proceeded with the prepping and draping.  The patient was prepped and draped.  I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The sponge, needle, and instrument count were completed at the end of the procedure.

Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing.,ICE:,Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways:,*  For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve.,*  For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place.,*  Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes.,*  Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes.,*  Reapply the ice.,*  Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable.,COMPRESSION:,Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury:,*  Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time.,*  Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site.,*  Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time.,ELEVATION:,Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.orthopedic, rest, ice, compression, and elevation, foot, ankle, knee, leg, splints, hand, wrist, elbow, arm, ace bandage, compression and elevation, rice therapy, compression bandage, ice packs, rice, elevation, swelling, bandage, therapy', 'label': 9}, {'id': 894, 'text': ""PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Degenerative disk disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Degenerative disk disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Anterior exposure diskectomy and fusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 150 mL.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

Symptoms improved temporarily, but did not completely resolve.  By the end of September, her pain had worsened and she was seen in the emergency room at ABC.  Chest x-ray was compatible with pleurisy and she was treated with Percocet.  Few days later, she was seen and given a prescription for Ultram because Percocet was causing nausea.  Eventually, she was seen by Dr. X and noted to have splenomegaly.  Repeat ultrasound was done and showed the spleen enlarged at 19 cm.

Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left was 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.

Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.,The patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.,The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.,The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.

Intravenous sedation was given as per Anesthesia.  The fiberoptic scope was passed through the #8 endotracheal tube into the main trachea.  The right mainstem bronchus was examined.  The right upper lobe and subsegments appeared grossly within normal limits with no endobronchial lesions noted.  Upon examining the right middle lobe, there was a tumor noted occluding the lateral segment of the right middle lobe and a clot appreciated over the medial segment of the right middle lobe.,The clot was lavaged with normal saline and there was noted to be tumor behind this clot.  Tumor completely occluded both segments of the right middle lobe.

Scope was pulled back to the level of the midtrachea, passed into the left mainstem bronchus.  Left upper lobe and its subsegments were examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions.  The lingula and left lower subsegments were all each individually examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions.  There were some secretions noted throughout the left lung.

The tumor was noted to be grossly friable with oozing noted from the tumor with minimal manipulation.  It did not appear as if a scope or cannula could be passed distal to the tumor.  Due to continued oozing, 1 cc of epinephrine was applied topically with adequate hemostasis obtained.  The area was examined for approximately one minute for assurance of adequate hemostasis.

This afternoon, when I am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a MAP of 52.  Dr. X was again consulted from the bedside.  We agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider Neo-Synephrine pressure support if this is not successful.  In addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient's possible move to Tahoe Pacific or a long-term acute care.  Other issues requiring following up today are elevated transaminases, continuing fever, pneumonia, resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, hypokalemia, non-ST-elevation MI, hypernatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, BPH, atrial flutter, inferior vena cava filter, and diabetes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  T-max 103.2, blood pressure at this point is running in the 70s/mid 40s with a MAP of 52, heart rate is 100.,GENERAL:  The patient is much more alert appearing than my last examination of approximately 3 weeks ago.

She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.,I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.,PROCEDURE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.

The patient began having prodromal symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to presentation.  She was seen on 03/09/2007 and a nonstress test was performed.  This revealed some spontaneous variable-appearing decelerations.  She was given IV hydration.  A biophysical profile was obtained, which provided a score of 0/8 with only a 1 cm fluid pocket found.  Therefore, she was admitted for further fetal monitoring and evaluation.  She had changed her cervix from closed 2 days prior to presentation to 1 cm dilated.  She was having somewhat irregular contractions, but with stronger contractions, continued to have decelerations to 50 to 60 beats per minute.  Due to these findings, a scalp electrode was placed as well as an IUPC for an amnioinfusion.  This relieved the decelerations somewhat.  However, over a period of time with strong contractions, she still had bradycardia 40 to 50 beats per minute and developed a late component on the return of the decelerations.  Due to this finding, it was evident that the fetal state would not support labor in order to accomplish a vaginal delivery.  These findings were reviewed with the patient and recommendation was made for cesarean section delivery.  The risks and benefits of this surgery were reviewed, and knowing these facts, the patient gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where her epidural anesthesia was reinforced.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate epidural level was confirmed, the scalp was utilized to make a transverse incision in the patient's lower abdominal wall.  This incision was carried down to the level of the fascia, which was also transversely incised.  After adequate hemostasis, the fascia was bluntly and sharply separated up from the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in midline exposing the peritoneum.  The peritoneum was carefully grasped and elevated with hemostats.  It was entered in an up and down fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The bladder blade was placed in the lower pole of the incision to protect the bladder.,The uterus was palpated and inspected.  A thin lower uterine segment was noted.  The vertex presentation was confirmed.  The scalp was then utilized to make a transverse or Kerr incision in the lower uterine wall.  Clear fluid was noted upon entering into the amniotic space.  At 05:27, a term viable female infant was delivered up through the incision.  She had spontaneous respirations.  She was given bulb suctioning for clear fluid.  Her cord was clamped and cut and she was delivered off the field to Dr. X who was attending.  The baby girl was subsequently signed Apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.  Her birth weight was found to be 5 pounds and 5 ounces.,The placenta was manually extracted from the endometrial cavity.  A ring clamp and two Allis clamps were placed around the margin of the uterine incision for hemostasis.  The uterus was delivered up into the operative field.  The endometrial cavity was swiped clean with a moist laparotomy pad.  The uterine incision was then closed in a two-layered fashion with 0 Vicryl suture, the first layer interlocking and the second layer imbricating.  Two additional stitches of 3-0 Vicryl suture were utilized for hemostasis.  The uterine incision was noted to be hemostatic upon closure.  The uterus was rotated forward, normal tubes and ovaries were noted on both sides.  The uterus was then returned to its normal position of the abdominal cavity.  The sponge and instrument count was performed for the first time at this point and found to be correct.  The pelvis and anterior uterine space was then irrigated with saline solution.  It was suctioned dry.  A final check of the uterine incision confirmed hemostasis.  The rectus muscle was stabilized across the midline with two simple stitches of 0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous tissue was then exposed, and the fascia closed with two running lengths of 0 Vicryl suture, beginning in lateral margins and overlapping the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was then irrigated and inspected.  No active bleeding was noted.  It was closed with a running length of 3-0 plain catgut suture.  The skin was then approximated with surgical steel staples.  The incision was infiltrated with a 0.5% solution of Marcaine local anesthetic.  The incision was cleansed and sterilely dressed.,The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The estimated blood loss through the procedure was 450 mL.

Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.

He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.

He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.,Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary.  However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery.  The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.  Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area.  Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result.  The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity.  We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.,The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.,A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh.  After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting.,The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion.,The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.,The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed.  We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.  We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.  A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.,We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery.  Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for.  Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area.  Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.

Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.

Risks and benefits have been discussed with him and his family at length including but not exclusive of continued infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, fractures, loss of bone, medical complications, surgical complications, transfusion related complications, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Presumed infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Deep extensive infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,2.  Biceps tenosynovitis.,3.  Massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder (full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm; supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm; infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm).,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was anesthetized in the supine position, a Foley catheter was placed in his bladder.  He was then placed Beach chair position and all bony prominences were well padded.  Pillows were placed around his knees to protect his sciatic nerve.  He was brought to the side of the table and secured with towels and tape.  The head was placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch.  Left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Unfortunately, preoperative antibiotics were given prior to the procedure.  This occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff.  The patient's extremity, however, was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been draped.  Also, Ioban bandages were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder.,Deltopectoral incision was then made.  The patient's had a cephalic vein, it was identified and protected throughout the case.  It was retracted laterally and once this has been completed, the deltopectoral interval was developed as carefully as possible.  The patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surfaces throughout the case.  As a result, he was transfused 1 unit postoperatively.  He did not have any problems during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure.  However this was due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus.  He had scar between the anterior capsular structures and the conjoint tendon.  Also there was significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus.  The deltoid was very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve.  Once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue was found, the proximal humerus was discovered to have a large defect, approximately 4 x 3.  This was covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which was fairly compressible, which felt to be purulent, however, when the needle was stuck into this area, there was no return of fluid.  As a result, this was finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudates which appeared to be old congealed, purulent material.  There was some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area.  This was all debrided but was found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment.  This later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm.  All of the mucinous material and fibrinous material was removed from the proximal humerus.  This was fairly extensive debridement.  All of this was sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity.  It should be noted that Gram stain became as multiple white blood cells but no organism seen.  The pathology came back as fibrinous material with multiple white cells, also with signs of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection.,Attention was then directed towards the anterior structures to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it.  There was also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which was fairly fibrinous.  This was also removed.  Once this was removed, though the capsule was found to be very thin, there was essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever.  It should also noted the patient's proximal humerus was subluxed superiorly so that there was no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever.  As a result, the biceps tendon was finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion.  The upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion was released in order to find the biceps.  It was tracked proximally and transverse ligament released.  The biceps tendon was flat and somewhat erythematous.  As a result, it released and tagged with an 0 Vicryl suture.  It was later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2-0 Prolene sutures.  The joint was then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid.  This was all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection.,Next, the humeral component was removed and this was done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which comes with the Biomet set.  Unfortunately, this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release.  As a result, bone contact of the metal proximally was released using a straight osteotome.  Once this was completed, another attempt was made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the areas of erosion of the infection and once this has been completed, we abandoned use of that particular device and using a __________ , we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it.  There was no cement.  There was exudate within the canal which was removed using a curette.,Using fluoroscopy, sequential reamers were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate.  This was also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic, and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection.  It should be noted that the reaming was done fluoroscopically to make sure that there was no penetration of the canal at any point.,The attention was then directed to the glenoid.  The glenoid component was very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose.  It was essentially removed with digital dissection.  There was no remaining cement in the cavity itself.  The patient's glenoid was very carefully debrided.  The glenoid itself was found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself.  This was debrided using rongeurs and curette until there was no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself.,Next, the entire wound was irrigated thoroughly with 9 liters of antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  Rather than place a spacer, it was elected to use antiobiotic beads.  This was with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin.  These beads were then connected using Prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself, also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region.  These three did not have a Prolene attached to them.  The ones placed down the canal did have a Prolene used as did the ones placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself.,The biceps tendon was then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon.  There was essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus.  It was electively the proximal humerus.  A portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces.  Deltopectoral was then closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, the deep subcutaneous tissues with 0-Vicryl sutures, superficial subcutaneous tissues with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with staples.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.,It should be noted that __________ is being requested for this case.  This was a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention.  Even though this was a standard revision case due to infection, there was a significant more decision making and technical challenges in this case and this was present for typical revision case.  Similarly, this case took approximately 30 to 40% more length of time due to bleeding and the attention to hemostasis.  The blood loss and operative findings indicates that this case was at least 30 to 40% more challenging than a standard total shoulder or revision case.  This is being dictated for insurance purposes only and reflects no inherent difficulties with the case whatsoever.orthopedic, incision and drainage, shoulder arthroplasty, extensive debridement, uncemented humeral, biomet, cemented, antibiotic beads, biceps tenosynovitis, rotator cuff tear, total shoulder arthroplasty, proximal humerus, vicryl sutures, glenoid, tendon, proximal, humerus, beads, shoulder, incision,"", 'label': 9}, {'id': 792, 'text': 'PROCEDURE:, Flexible bronchoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Chronic wheezing.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, Evaluate the airway.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,This was done in the pediatric endoscopy suite with the aid of Anesthesia.

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.

She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.  At the end of the procedure, the sponge that was pushed into the vagina previously was removed and hemostasis was appreciated vaginally.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.

Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

A sterile tourniquet was positioned and tourniquet was inflated at 250 mmHg.  Perioperative antibiotics were infused.  Time-out procedure was called.  The medial epicondyle and the olecranon tip were well palpated.  The incision was initiated at equidistant between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle extending 3-4 cm proximally and 6-8 cm distally.  The ulnar nerve was identified proximally.  It was mobilized with a blunt and a sharp dissection proximally to the arcade of Struthers, which was released sharply.  The roof of the cubital tunnel was then incised and the nerve was mobilized distally to its motor branches.  The ulnar nerve was well-isolated before it entered the cubital tunnel.  The arch of the FCU was well defined.  The fascia was elevated from the nerve and both the FCU fascia and the Osborne fascia were divided protecting the nerve under direct visualization.

The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.

General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.neurology, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath, abdominis, muscle, rectus, sheath', 'label': 6}, {'id': 762, 'text': 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Retained hardware, right ulnar.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Retained hardware, right ulnar,PROCEDURE: , Hardware removal, right ulnar.,ANESTHESIA:,  The patient received 2.5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine and local anesthetic.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.

Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation.,2.  Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.,HISTORY: , This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.  The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d.

The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.

The patient was put in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped for dilatation and curettage in a routine fashion.,An insulated posterior weighted retractor was put in.  Using the LEEP tenaculum, we were able to grasp the anterior lip of the cervix with a large wire loop at 35 cutting, 30 coagulation.  The endocervical polyp on the posterior lip of the cervix was excised.,Then changing from a 50 of coagulation and 5 cutting, the base of the polyp was electrocoagulated, which controlled all the bleeding.  The wire loop was attached, and the pigmented raised nevus on the inner thigh was excised with the wire loop.  Cautery of the base was done, and then it was closed with figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  A band-aid was applied over this.,Rechecking the cervix, no bleeding was noted.  The patient was laid flat on the table, awakened, and moved to the recovery room bed and sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.surgery, endocervical polyp, pigmented mole, polyp, leep tenaculum, leep, cervix, endocervical, pigmented ', 'label': 25}, {'id': 4607, 'text': 'P.O.

It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINTS: , Improved focal lower back pain.,HISTORY: , Abc is a 26-year-old man who immigrated to this country approximately six years ago. He speaks ""un poquito"" English and an interpreter is provided. He has worked for the last four years at Floragon Forest Products, where he normally functions as a ""stacker."" He indicates that another worker was on vacation, and because of this he was put on another job in which he separated logs using a picaroon. He was doing this on April 20, 2003, and was pulling on the picaroon when it gave way, and he fell backwards landing on a metal step, which was approximately 1 foot off of the ground. He demonstrates that he came down square on the step and did not fall backwards or hyperextend over it. He did not hit his upper back or neck or shoulders, and only sat down on the step as described. He had ""a little"" pain in his back at that time, but was able to get up and continue working. He completed his shift that day and returned to work the following day. He had the next two days off. He says that his symptoms persisted and increased, and on April 25, 2003, he went to the First Choice Physicians Chiropractic and Rehab Clinic, where he came under the care of Dr. Abcd, DC. The file contains an entrance form completed by Mr. Abc which indicates at the bottom under ""previous occurrence of the same pain"" a notation of ""Yes, but it was not really the same, it was just a little and tolerable."" There is an additional note on the side which states ""no pain prior to this injury or on that day, occasional (but low back)."" Saw this notation, he says today that he did not state this and that the form was done by ""Edna"" at Dr. Abcd\'s office.,Mr. Abc was initially treated three times a week and states that this has now been reduced to twice per week. He does not know how long the chiropractic treatment is to continue. Initially, he has been seen by Dr. Xyz on three occasions, the last being on August 15, 2003. Dr. Xyz has basically referred him back to Dr. Abcd for continued chiropractic management.,Mr. Abc has now returned to his normal job as a stacker and is able to do that with no significant increased pain. He does mention, however, that bending over, picking up anything particularly heavy is bothersome; however, he does not normally have to do that. He denies any new accident or injury that would be contributory either as a result of his work or outside activities or any motor vehicle accident. He does not participate physically in any sports or hobbies that would be a factor.,PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , Mr. Abc indicates at this time that he is overall better in that initially he had difficulty ""moving."" He grades his current overall level of pain as a 2 to 4 on a scale from 0 to 10, stating that the worst he had was at 6-7. He now has ""good and bad days"" which depends on his activity level noting that he is better over the weekend. He localizes his pain to the midline lumbosacral region. He states that initially he did experience some diffuse radiation into both lower extremities, but that this has now resolved. He occasionally will notice some tightness behind both knees, but again no radicular type of distribution. He denies any focal muscular weakness or sphincter disturbance. His quality of the pain at this time is a ""tightness"" which bothers him, again, primarily with bending at the waist and lifting. He is able to do his normal activities of life, including his work without any significant problem, noting again only increased pain with bending and lifting.,PAST HISTORY: , Mr. Abc denies any prior similar complaints or treatments. He denies any previous specific lower back injury. He has enjoyed essentially good lifetime health and denies any concurrent medical conditions or problems. He has seasonal allergies only with no known drug hypersensitivities. He has not been hospitalized overnight and has had no surgeries in his life. He currently takes OTC Advil and Tylenol for lower back pain, but no prescriptive medication. He does not smoke, drink, or use street drugs of any type. Review of systems and family history are generally noncontributory.,SOCIO-ECONOMIC HISTORY: , Mr. Abc, as indicated, was born and reared in Mexico and immigrated into this country six years ago.,Education: He has our equivalent of a high school education in Mexico with no additional formal education in United States.,Military History: He has no military experience in his life.,Work History: He currently is doing his normal work activities as a stacker without arbitrary restrictions or limitations. He is not receiving any Workers Compensation or other benefits at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Abc presents as a cooperative and straightforward 26-year-old Hispanic male. He has a very thin body habitus with a reported height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight of 125 pounds. He is right hand dominant. He is noted to sit comfortably throughout the history taking process conversant with the interpreter and myself without observable guarding or postural conversation or motion. He did stand readily to full upright with equal weightbearing and exhibits normal spinal posture with double hips and shoulders. Lumbar lordosis is normal. He ambulates without a limp or lift, and is able to walk on heels and toes and perform a full squat and rise and hop without difficulty with some expression of increased lower back pain. Waddell\'s testing is negative on compression and traction with some slight increased lower back pain on passive rotation.,Kemp\'s maneuver of posterolateral bending has some increased localized lumbosacral pain, but no radiation distally into the buttocks or lower extremities.,Active lumbar ranges of motion with double inclinometer are:,Flexion 70 degrees.,Extension 20 degrees.,Side bending symmetric at 28 degrees.,He complains of lower back pain at the extremes of flexion only. Motion palpation reveals full mobility without any detectable intrasegmental fixation with normal symmetry and alignment.,Tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees and ankles without sensory loss to pinprick. Babinski\'s are neutral, and there is no clonus.,Manual muscle testing reveals 5/5 strength at the hips, knees, and ankles without give-way or complaint.,Supine passive straight leg raising is limited by hamstring tightness to 66 degrees bilaterally, but causes no expression of lower back pain or radiation. Cross leg with rotation hip joint motion is full on either side without reported hip or back pain. Hip flexion is symmetric at 130 degrees, again without complaint. Leg lengths appeared visually symmetric. Mid calf girth is 11-1/2 inches bilaterally. Five inches above the knees measured 13 inches right and left. The seated SLR is done to 90 degrees, and he brings his fingertips 2 inches from his toes, showing good flexibility at the waist despite the hamstring tightness noted in the supine straight leg raising test.,In the prone position, he has good gluteal strength on either side with Yeoman\'s test causing some increased lumbosacral pain but no focal sacroiliac involvement. No sacroiliac fixation is identified. Hibbs test is negative on either side.,On palpation, he reports midline tenderness at L5-S1 without additional areas of tenderness noted even to very firm palpatory pressure in the entirety of the lumbar spine over the pelvis. He indicates no focal or sacroiliac, sciatic notch, or trochanteric tenderness on either side. No definitive muscular spasm is noted in the lumbar paraspinal musculature.,Mr. Abc tolerated the examination process without apparent or expressed ill effect. ,IMAGING STUDIES:,  AP and lateral lumbar/pelvic views dated May 15, 2003 are reviewed. The films are negative for recent fracture or pathology. There appears to be a transitional lumbosacral area with a spatulated transverse process of L1 and slight narrowing of the lumbosacral disc space. No additional abnormalities are identified. The hip and sacroiliac articulations appear well preserved. Disc spacing in the rest of the lumbar spine appears normal, and no significant degenerative changes are identified. Soft tissue appeared normal without paraspinal mass or abnormality.,DIAGNOSIS: , Lumbosacral contusion/strain relative to the April 20, 2003 industrial accident - objectively resolved.,SUMMARY: , Discussion and recommendations in response to questions posed in your August 15, 2003 letter:,1. What is your diagnosis of the worker\'s condition as a result of the injury? Please provide objective medical findings that support your diagnosis. Please indicate if the objective findings are reproducible, measurable, or observable, and how.,The diagnosis of the workers condition secondary to the described April 20, 2003 fall is by history a lumbosacral contusion/strain. This impression is primarily made based on his history noting that at this time, he has no abnormal objective findings.,2. In your opinion, is the work injury a contributing cause of the diagnosis? If so, is the work injury the material contributing cause of the diagnosis? Please provide an explanation for your opinion.,It would appear that the work injury was the major contributing cause of the diagnosis.,3. Are there any off work factors that may have caused or contributed to the worker\'s current complaints or condition?

The patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  The patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  The patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  The patient has been on IV antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,After an IV was started by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  A restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of Webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the Department of Anesthesia.  After adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  The foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was elevated and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  Using Band-Aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,Using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  Using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  Then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  Care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  After cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  The head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  Attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  All remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  Areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  Due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, I thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  Therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  Deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  This was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  Following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  The wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using Kling and Kerlix and an ACE bandage to provide compression.  The tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  The ACE bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  Sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  The patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.  The patient was instructed to continue her regular medications.  The patient was to continue IV antibiotic course and was given prescription for Vicoprofen to be taken q.4h. p.r.n. for moderate to severe pain #30.  The patient will followup with Podiatry on Monday morning at 8:30 in the Podiatry Clinic for dressing change and evaluation of her foot at that time.,The patient was instructed as to signs and symptoms of infection, was instructed to return to the Emergency Department immediately if these should present.

She has been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient has agreed to proceed with surgery as described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There was noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system was utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She was administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet was placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision was made.  The patella was then everted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated.  A drill hole was placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guides were positioned in place.  The appropriate cuts were made at the distal femur as well as with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component was then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention was then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide was positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut was made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments remained intact throughout the procedure as well as the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnants of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci were resected.  The tibial trial was positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiographs were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial holes were then drilled.  The patella was then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide was positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella was resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill holes were made within the patella after it was determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee was placed through range of motion with the trial components marked and then the appropriate components obtained.  The tibial tray was inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate was removed.  The femoral component was inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly was positioned in place and the knee was held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate was also used at the patella.  The prosthesis was positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate was firm.  After all three components were in place, the knee was then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component was removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate was removed.  Further irrigation was performed and then a stemmed template was positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component was positioned in place.  Knee was placed through range of motion and the tracking was better.  Actual component was then obtained, methyl methacrylate was placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component was impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly was then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate was solidified.  The trial Poly was removed.  Wound was irrigated and the joint was inspected.  There was no debris.  Collateral ligaments and posterior cruciate ligaments remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing was done and a 17 mm Poly was then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral components with good tracking as well as the patellar component.  The tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  A drain was placed into the depths of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision was closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee was placed through range of motion and there was no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound was cleansed as well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulses were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status was intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.

The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7.  The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass.  Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time.  The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.,Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed.

The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection.  The peritoneum was open.  Abdomen was entered.  There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line.  A gel porter was placed.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially.  Duodenum was cauterized.  Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around.  Pictures were taken.  Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes.  The 2 lesions were frozen.  The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter.  So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used.  Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done.  The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done.  The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart.  There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign.  The probes were removed.,The probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.,After freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed.  Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding.  From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes.  So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again.  Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure.  There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure.  Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ.  The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times.  Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen.  The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions.  At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially.  Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel.  Lap count was correct.  Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions.  No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding.  The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision.  The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion.  After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.surgery, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation, laparoscopic, cryoablation, bilateral renal mass, fibrin glue, laparoscopic cryoablation, renal insufficiency, renal lesions, renal biopsy, renal mass, insufficiency, renal, freezing/thawing, lesions"", 'label': 25}, {'id': 2332, 'text': ""PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral Crawford subtalar arthrodesis with open Achilles Z-lengthening and bilateral long-leg cast.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.

He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

After this, the patient was then placed under total IV anesthesia and the operating bed was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg.  The patient's sternal notch along with cricoid and thyroid cartilages were noted and palpated and a sternal marker was utilized to mark the cricoid cartilage in the sternal notch.  The midline was also marked and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 at approximately 4 cc total was then utilized to localize the neck.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped with Hibiclens.  A skin incision was then made in the midline with a #15 Bard-Parker in a vertical fashion.  After this, the skin was retracted laterally and a small anterior jugular branch was clamped and cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties.  Further bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization and attention was then drawn down on to the strap muscles.  The patient's sternohyoid muscle was identified and grasped on either side and the midline raphe was identified.  Cauterization was then utilized to take down the midline raphe and further dissection was utilized with the skin hook and stat clamps.  The anterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus was identified and palpation on the cricoid cartilage was performed.  The cricoid cauterization over the cricoid cartilage was obtained with the monopolar cauterization and blunt dissection then was carried along the posterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus.  Stats were then placed on either side of the thyroid isthmus and the mid portion was bisected with the monopolar cauterization.  After this, the patient's anterior trachea was then identified and cleaned with pusher.  After this, the cricoid cartilage along the first and second tracheal rings was identified.  The cricoid hook was placed and the trachea was brought more anteriorly and superiorly.  After this, the patient's head incision was placed below the second tracheal ring with a #15 Bard-Parker.  After this, the patient had a tracheal punch with the SCOOP FastTract kit to create a small 4 mm punch within the tracheal cartilage.  After this, the patient then had a tracheal stent placed within the tracheal punched lumen and the patient was then had the tracheal stent secured to the neck with a Vicryl strap.  After this, the cricoid hook was removed and the patient then had FiO2 on the monitor noted with pulse oximetry of 100%.

These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.,Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.  The patient tolerated the entire procedure well.  She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.

Since then, she has generally done well.  She used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in September 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy.,The patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  Recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  Yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  The discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  Later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  She denied any diarrhea.  No history of fever or chills.  Since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  She was given morphine, Zofran, Demerol, another Zofran, and Reglan as well as Demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  Subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  The patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  At the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  She has not been fed any food, however.  The patient also had had pelvis and abdominal CT scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  The patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described.  A 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney.

The vessel continues as a small vessel, tapering at the apex of the left ventricle. There is calcific plaque within the mid vessel, with dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the second diagonal branch. This limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of a high-grade stenosis. There is ostial calcification within the second diagonal branch as well. The LAD distal to the second diagonal branch is small relative to the more proximal vessel, and this is worrisome for a proximal flow-limiting lesion.,In addition, there is marked tapering of the D2 branch distal to the proximal and ostial calcific plaque. This is worrisome for either occlusion or a high-grade stenosis.

There is calcific plaque within the proximal vessel. There is dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the OM1, and the AV groove branch. The AV groove branch tapers as a small vessel at the base of the heart. The dense calcific plaque within the bifurcation of the OM1 and the AV groove branch limits evaluation of the vessel lumen. There is no demonstrated high-grade stenosis, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.,RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:,The right coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium.

He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.,The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.  The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.,The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline.  The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers.  The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was placed on the wound.

The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.

She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor\'s note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient\' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X\'s physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A\'s and B\'s.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women\'s groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Testnan', 'label': 6}, {'id': 327, 'text': 'PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Stab wound, left posterolateral chest.,POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: , Stab wound, left posterolateral chest.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Closure of stab wound.,ANESTHESIA: , 1% lidocaine with epinephrine by local infiltration.,NARRATIVE:  ,The wound was irrigated copiously with 500 mL of irrigation and closed in 1 layer with staples after locally anesthetizing with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.

Revision of distal anastomosis with 7 mm interposition Gore-Tex graft.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with controlled ventillation.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 58-year-old black male with chronic renal failure.  He undergoes dialysis through the left forearm bridge fistula and has small pseudoaneurysms at the needle puncture sites level.  There is narrowing at the distal anastomosis due to intimal hypoplasia and the vein beyond it was of good quality.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite, placed in supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Left arm was prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was created just below the antecubital crease just deeper to the subcutaneous tissue.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections segment of the fistula was isolated ________ vessel loop.  Transverse graftotomy was created.  A #4 Fogarty catheter passed proximally and distally restoring inflow and meager inflow.  A fistulogram was performed and the above findings were noted.  In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.  Longitudinal venotomy created along the anteromedial wall.  A 7 mm graft was brought on to the field and this was cut to shape and size.  This was sewed to the graft in an end-to-side fashion with U-clips anchoring the graft at the heel and toe with interrupted #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The vein flushed with heparinized saline and graft was controlled with vascular clamp.  The end of the insertion graft was cut to shape in length and sutured to the graft in an end-to-end fashion with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The graftotomy was then closed with interrupted #6-0 Prolene suture.  Flow through the fistula was permitted, a good flow passed.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needles, instrument counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in apparent stable condition.cardiovascular / pulmonary, chronic renal failure, thrombosed, gore-tex bridge fistula, arteriovenous, fogarty, thrombectomy, anastomosis, gore tex bridge, fogarty thrombectomy, prolene suture, renal failure, distal anastomosis, bridge fistula, interposition, renal, prolene', 'label': 33}]"
